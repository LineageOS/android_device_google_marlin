    <!-- In AppAttributes, PackageName is must.
         ActivityName and VersionCode are optional and can be used to
        further restrict the whitelisting in terms of when and where to apply

        1. <AppAttributes PackageName="com.imangi.templerun" />
            Straight forward whitelisting when activityTrigger is called with this PackageName
        2. <AppAttributes PackageName="com.imangi.templerun"
                          ActivityName="com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerProxyActivity" />
            Updating ApplicationInfo to override the resolution is done when activityTrigger
            is called with both the above PackageName and ActivityName
        3. <AppAttributes PackageName="com.imangi.templerun"
                          VersionCode="11" />
            Same as (1) but happens when app is of verionCode 11
        4. <AppAttributes PackageName="com.imangi.templerun"
                          ActivityName="com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerProxyActivity"
                          VersionCode="11" />
